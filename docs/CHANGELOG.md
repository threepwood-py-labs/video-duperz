# Changelog

## 2026-06-04

- Added automated Windows release packaging for a public onefile executable,
  portable zip, checksums, artifact upload, GitHub Release publishing, and
  provenance attestation.
- Hardened GitHub CI with isolated Windows test profiles, branch concurrency,
  split coverage buckets, and pytest timeouts so GUI modal regressions fail
  with actionable logs instead of hanging hosted runners.

## 2026-03-20

- Added a dedicated per-lane `ETA` column to the Scan tab so each worker lane shows its own completion estimate beside the progress bar instead of cramming ETA into the progress cell.
- Added configurable `fingerprint_timeout_s` scan tuning, exposed in Scan Performance and threaded through GUI scans, CLI scans, and guarded decoder fallback attempts while preserving risky-format timeout multiplication.
- Changed first-run scan defaults to use `same_aspect` cross-resolution matching, below-normal/background scan priorities, and a worker budget capped by detected physical drives.

## 2026-03-19

- Added visible `FPS`, `Bit Depth`, and `HDR Format` metadata columns to Results so near-identical files can be compared on frame rate, bit depth, and HDR type instead of a coarse HDR yes/no flag.
- Replaced the old boolean HDR metadata model with persisted `hdr_format` strings and threaded `bit_depth` / `hdr_format` through probe caching, duplicate-group loading, and results filtering.
- Updated keep-quality scoring so higher bit-depth encodes win when resolution, bitrate, and codec are otherwise similar, with 10-bit and 12-bit files receiving progressively stronger bonuses.
- Added opt-in scene-aware visual sampling, cached by its own fingerprint algorithm version so scene-based and fixed-percentage fingerprints can coexist safely.
- Added optional `fpcalc` audio fingerprinting as a secondary duplicate signal, including cached audio artifacts, non-fatal scan issues when the tool is unavailable, and `Audio` match badges in Results.
- Added a `Custom` similarity profile with a numeric threshold control in Sources, and threaded that threshold through saved scan profiles, paused-scan reloads, scan-set identity, and matcher decisions.
- Added cross-resolution duplicate matching modes so users can keep strict aspect gating by default or relax it for near-identical releases with different framing or output sizes.
- Added duration-difference duplicate matching so near-identical videos can still group when one copy is a few seconds longer or shorter due to trims or timestamp drift.
- Exposed `duration_tolerance_s` in the Sources tab and persisted it through settings, scan workers, and the runtime matcher pipeline.
- Switched duration-mismatched duplicate comparisons to an inner-frame hash path so intro/outro drift no longer dominates the median-distance decision.
- Persisted duplicate match reasons in SQLite and added a visible `Match` column in Results, including `Trimmed` labeling with duration-delta tooltip details.
- Added unit, GUI, runtime, and ffmpeg-backed integration coverage for tolerance threading, trimmed-match persistence, and the new results rendering path.

## 2026-03-15

- Added guarded fingerprint decoder fallbacks so fingerprinting no longer hangs indefinitely on pathological media files.
- Routed `wmv` and `asf` files away from the OpenCV fingerprint path and through `ffmpeg -> PyAV` with a hard `15s` timeout per decoder attempt.
- Kept the fast path for normal formats as `OpenCV -> PyAV -> ffmpeg`, preserving the existing dHash frame-normalization logic while making each decoder attempt killable.
- Persisted quiet fingerprint decoder provenance in SQLite so successful fallbacks and decoder timeouts can be inspected later without surfacing extra scan issues for recovered files.
- Added a hidden `fingerprint-child` CLI entrypoint used by the guarded decoder subprocess path.
- Added unit coverage for risky-format routing, decoder fallback sequencing, structured child-process responses, GUI backend-availability handling, and fingerprint provenance persistence.
- Validated the new behavior read-only on real media sets, including a previously wedged WMV sample and larger deterministic mixed-library sample sets.
- Added internal benchmark planning and evaluation helpers for deterministic sample sets, lane-safe scheduling, and per-lane fallback/timeout telemetry without changing production `burst` behavior.
